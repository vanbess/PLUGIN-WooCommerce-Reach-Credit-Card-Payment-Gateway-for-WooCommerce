# Silverback WooCommerce Reach Credit Card payment gateway

This is a condensed/improved/stripped down version of Reach's credit card payment gateway. Contract/subscription methodology along with PayPal has been stripped out, and consumer error messaging on the checkout page has been improved significantly. 

The built in currency conversion methodology has been stripped out as well as the plugin Currency Switcher for WooCommerce Pro is used for this functionality (installed separately) and will likely cause issues and/or conflicts as a result.

Reach uses Adyen to process credit card transactions. Despite this, their transaction fees are more competitive than going to Adyen directly, which is ironic, but there you go.
