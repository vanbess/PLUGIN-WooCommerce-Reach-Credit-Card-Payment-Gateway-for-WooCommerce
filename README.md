# Silverback WooCommerce Reach Credit Card payment gateway

This is a condensed/improved/stripped down version of Reach's credit card payment gateway. Contract/subscription methodology along with PayPal has been stripped out, and consumer error messaging on the checkout page has been improved significantly. 

Reach uses Adyen to process credit card transactions. Despite this, their transaction fees are more competitive than going to Adyen directly, which is ironic, but here you go.
